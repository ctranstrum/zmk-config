## Aurora Sweep

[Sweep Keymap](images/splitkb_aurora_sweep.svg)

My first wireless split, after using the Planck EZ.

- 34 keys
- per-key RGB
- underglow RGB
- nice!view

Got this working great, but two main issues:

- lack of support for per-key per-layer color coding
- batteries last for shit

## Totem

[Totem Keymap](config/totem.keymap)

Fell in love with this design, decided to try it out, no extras to deplete the batteries.

- 38 keys

And I eventually added:

- OLED dongle (see [the diff](https://github.com/ctranstrum/zmk-config/compare/13bcedf..36b5014) if you want to make one, too)

and with that, the batteries, which used to need recharged after about six days, now last about two months, even though they are tiny.

Pretty sweet board, all in all. However:

- I'm not sure I love the choc spacing
- That one extra pinky key is surprisingly nice, leaves me wanting more now ...

## Klor

I bought one of these and set it up with QMK, and I really liked it, but I wanted choc and wireless, and finally set it up.

- 42 keys
- 2 encoders
- OLED dongle
- per-key RGB on the QMK version, but not on my wireless

## Kyria

[Kyria Keymap](config/trikyria.keymap)

My biggest split yet.

- 50 keys
- OLED dongle

## Lintilla

[Lintilla Keymap](config/lintilla.keymap)

I got tired of everything being close enough but not quite, so I finally took the plunge with ergogen and designed my own keyboard.

The key layout is heavily influenced by the Klor, with the case influenced by the Ergonaut One.

- 42 keys
- reversible board with the xiao ble
- rgbled widget
- large battery "hidden" in a pcb cutout
- 3D printed sandwich case without standoffs
