# ZMK Config Repo

## Aurora Sweep

My first wireless split, after using the Planck EZ.

- 34 keys
- per-key RGB
- underglow RGB
- nice!view

Got this working great, but two main issues:

- lack of support for per-key per-layer color coding
- batteries last for shit

## Totem

Fell in love with this design, decided to try it out, no extras to deplete the batteries.

- 38 keys

And I eventually added:

- OLED dongle (see [the diff](https://github.com/ctranstrum/zmk-config/compare/13bcedf..36b5014) if you want to make one, too)

and with that, the batteries, which used to need recharged after about six days, now last about two months, even though they are tiny.

Pretty sweet board, all in all. However:

- I'm not sure I love the choc spacing
- That one extra pinky key is surprisingly nice, leaves me wanting more now ...

## Kyria

My biggest split yet.

- 50 keys
- OLED dongle

Work in progress...
